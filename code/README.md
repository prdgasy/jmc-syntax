## Features

This extension turns VS Code into a full-fledged IDE for JMC development, providing all the features you'd expect:

*   ✅ **Advanced Syntax Highlighting**: Clear and distinct highlighting for JMC keywords, functions, variables, strings, and comments.
*   ✅ **Smart Snippets**: Time-saving snippets for all built-in JMC functions.
*   ✅ **Hover Support**: Hover over a function (native or your own), a variable (`$score` or `::storage`), or a keyword to instantly see its documentation and signature.
*   ✅ **Docstring Support**: Document your own functions using multi-line `@description` comments with full Markdown support. The extension will display them on hover.
*   ✅ **Signature Help**: As you type a function call, a contextual helper shows the expected parameters and their types, guiding you along the way.
*   ✅ **Go to Definition & Find All References**: Easily navigate your codebase. Right-click a function call to jump to its definition or find all of its usages within the file.
*   ✅ **Intelligent Autocompletion**: Get smart completion suggestions for variables, user-defined functions, classes, and import paths (`import "..."`).
*   ✅ **Import Navigation**: `Ctrl+Click` on an import path to open the corresponding file directly.
*   ✅ **Custom File Icons**: A dedicated icon for `.jmc` files, making them easy to spot in the file explorer.
